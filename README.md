# HivePython
Read temperature values from Hive API using Python

This is a quick and dirty Python script I have put together to read temperature values from the Hive API.

# Usage
Change the following values:
hiveuser = "USERNAME@EMAIL.NONE"
hivepass = "123456789"

The script will create the following variables that you can then use:
inside
outside
target
